# In this project I analyze a Netflix dataset.
- The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows
- I took it to Google Sheets to clean it and the final result is here: [netflix_titles - netflix_titles (1).csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16692060/netflix_titles.-.netflix_titles.1.csv)
- Then I took the result to Google Cloud (BigQuery) to make the analysis by SQL - The files are attached.

# I Also made a Dashboard in Tableau for the resultant data: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mostafa.elbassel/viz/NetflixDashboard_17242503459060/NetflixDasboard#1
